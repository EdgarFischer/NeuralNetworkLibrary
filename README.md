Our goal was to build a neural network library from scratch and test it on a data set.

A total of three members contributed to this project: Hauke  was responsible to build the classes relevant for the creation and training of a neural network.
Christoph was responsible to create an algoirhtm for automatic hyper parameter optimization.
Maciej applied these algorithms to a data set and compared it to various other algorithms.

Examples of to use the code are provided.
